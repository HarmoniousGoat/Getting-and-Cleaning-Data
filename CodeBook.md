Variable Names and Descriptions in Smartphones_Dataset:
============================================================================

— “Subject_ID”: the subject ID.

— “Experiment_Type”: whether the subject underwent the training scenario or the test scenario in the experiment.

— “Activity”: the type of activity the subject was doing with his/her smartphone. 

— “Set_Mean”: mean of a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.

— “Set_SD”: standard deviation of a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.

————————————————————————————————————————————

— “Body_Acceleration_X.Axis_Mean”: mean (from a 128 element vector) of the body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

— “Body_Acceleration_X.Axis_SD”: standard deviation (from a 128 element vector) of the body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

**Other Body Acceleration Variables: same as described but for the Y and Z axis.**

— “Angular_Velocity_X.Axis_Mean”: mean (from a 128 element vector) of the angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample.

— “Angular_Velocity_X.Axis_SD”: standard deviation (from a 128 element vector) of the angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample.

**Other Angular Velocity Variables: same as described but for the Y and Z axis.**

— “Total_Acceleration_X.Axis_Mean”: mean (from a 128 element vector) of the acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'.

— “Total_Acceleration_X.Axis_SD”: standard deviation (from a 128 element vector) of the acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'.

**Other Total Acceleration Variables: same as described but for the Y and Z axis.**
